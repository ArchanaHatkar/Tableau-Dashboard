# AH Bank ltd. Dashboard
## Project Objective
The AH Bank Ltd. Dashboard provides an overview of key customer demographics and business insights, including job classification, customer growth, top customers, regional distribution, and gender split. It visualizes data using treemaps, bar charts, and pie charts to help stakeholders understand customer trends and make data-driven decisions.
Key Insights
#### 1. Job Classification
The majority of customers belong to the White Collar segment (48.70%).
Blue Collar workers account for 26.13%, indicating a significant share.
The Other category makes up 25.16%, which may include freelancers, students, or retirees.
Insight: AH Bank serves a diverse range of customers, but there is a higher concentration of white-collar professionals. Tailored banking products for this segment could improve engagement.

#### 2. Customer Growth (Monthly New Customers)
There is a visible increase in new customers from April onward.
The highest growth months appear to be September, October, and November.
Initial months (January–March) have significantly lower customer acquisition.
Insight: The bank experiences seasonal growth trends, possibly due to financial year cycles or promotional campaigns. Analyzing these trends further can help optimize marketing strategies.

#### 3. Top Customers
Some of the top individual customers include Dorothy Jackson, Carl Fraser, and Connor North.
This suggests a high-value customer segment that contributes significantly to the bank’s revenue.
Insight: Identifying spending behaviors of these top customers can help the bank design exclusive loyalty programs.

#### 4. Region-Wise Customer Distribution
England holds the largest customer base (53.79%).
Other regions contribute the remaining portion, but their exact proportions are smaller.
Insight: Since England dominates the customer base, region-specific banking solutions should be prioritized. Expansion strategies could focus on underrepresented regions.

#### 5. Gender Split
Male customers (53.94%) slightly outnumber female customers (46.06%).
The gender ratio is relatively balanced.
Insight: AH Bank has a diverse customer base, which suggests that marketing efforts should be inclusive to cater to both genders equally.

#### Conclusion
This dashboard highlights the bank’s customer demographics, growth trends, and key business opportunities. Understanding customer segments, regional strengths, and top-performing individuals can help optimize banking products and services for better customer engagement and business growth.
